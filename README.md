# Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**.  
This repository serves as a digital portfolio showcasing my coursework and applied projects at the intersection of economic theory, statistics, and modern data science.

I am an undergraduate economics student seeking roles in **Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance**, with a strong interest in using data-driven methods to solve real-world economic problems.

## About This Portfolio

This repository contains labs, assignments, and applied exercises from ECON 3916. The course is built around a **Concept Extension** philosophy: we begin with core statistical and econometric ideas and extend them into more scalable machine learning techniques.

Through this work, I am learning how to:
- Combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Extend traditional econometric models (e.g., OLS regression) into machine learning frameworks (e.g., Lasso and regularization)
- Apply modern data science tools while maintaining economic intuition and interpretability

Overall, this portfolio reflects my goal of bridging the gap between **classical economic reasoning** and **practical, modern data science**.
